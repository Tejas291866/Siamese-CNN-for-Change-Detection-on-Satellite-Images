# Siamese-CNN-for-Change-Detection-on-Satellite-Images
This repository contains the implementation of a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting changes in satellite images. The model has been trained on the WHU RS Change Detection Dataset and outputs binary change maps that identify regions of significant changes between pre-change and post-change images.
